LIVE SERVER @ [sweetkidz.jit.su](http://sweetkidz.jit.su)

SweetKidz is a HTML5/JavaScript multiplayer game experiment. The core code is based on Mozilla's BrowserQuest and this project serves as mostly a learning tool for myself.

Feel free to contribute to this project. I would love the chance to actively collaborate.
